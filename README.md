# Timeseries_modelling



This project consists of building a time series model to create an hourly forecast of temperature for a retail store. The Storeâ€™s analysts believe that extreme outdoor temperatures may affect the sales of the main retail store in Harrisburg,PA; They want a forecast of these temperatures to help them further evaluate this claim. The model is built using ARIMA modelling

A retail store wants to build a weekly sales forecast model for two of its stores in - Phoenix and Tucson, AZ

The R script includes code for the following visualizations and models-

Creating time series object and plotting it

Building Linear Expotential Smoothing Model for both Tucson and Pheonix

Calculating Mean Absolute Percentage Error

Checking Stationarity through plots

Building Autoregressive Models for Tucson and Pheonix

ACF and PACF plots of residuals

White noise Tests and plots

Forecasting sales

Checking Accuracy on the validation dataset
